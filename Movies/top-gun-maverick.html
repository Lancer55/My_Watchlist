            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                After more than thirty years of service as one of the Navy's top aviators, 
                Pete "Maverick" Mitchell is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a 
                courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would 
                ground him. When he finds himself training a detachment of Top Gun 
                graduates for a specialized mission the likes of which no living pilot 
                has ever seen, Maverick encounters Lt. Bradley Bradshaw, call sign: 
                "Rooster," the son of Maverick's late friend and Radar Intercept 
                Officer Lt. Nick Bradshaw, aka "Goose."
