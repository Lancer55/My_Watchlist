            <p>
                K.G.F: Chapter 2 is the 2022 sequel to the 2018 film. The blood-soaked 
                land of Kolar Gold Fields (KGF) now has a new overlord—Rocky, whose 
                name strikes fear in the heart of his foes. While his allies look up 
                to him as their savior, the government sees him as a threat to law 
                and order; Rocky must battle threats from all sides for unchallenged 
                supremacy.
