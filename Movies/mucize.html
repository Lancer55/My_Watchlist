            <p>
                Set in the 1960s, a schoolteacher named Mahir is transferred to a 
                remote village in eastern Turkey. Upon arrival, he discovers that the 
                village has no school and the children have never had an education. 
                Determined to change their lives, he helps build a school and forms 
                a profound bond with Aziz, a disabled man who has been marginalized 
                by the community. Through patience and love, Mahir witnesses a 
                miraculous transformation that challenges the village's prejudices.
