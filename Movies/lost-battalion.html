            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                Based on a true story from World War I, the film follows Major Charles Whittlesey 
                and over 500 soldiers of the 77th Division who are cut off and surrounded 
                by German forces in the Argonne Forest. Refusing to surrender despite 
                running out of food, water, and ammunition, the "Lost Battalion" must 
                endure several days of relentless attacks and friendly fire while waiting 
                for a breakthrough.
