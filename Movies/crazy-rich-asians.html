            <p>
                New Yorker Rachel Chu accompanies her longtime boyfriend, Nick Young, 
                to his best friend's wedding in Singapore. Excited about visiting 
                Asia for the first time but nervous about meeting Nick's family, 
                Rachel is unprepared to learn that Nick has neglected to mention a 
                few key details about his life: he is the scion of one of the 
                country's wealthiest families and one of its most eligible bachelors.
