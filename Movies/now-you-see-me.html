            <p>
                An FBI agent and an Interpol detective track a team of illusionists 
                known as "The Four Horsemen." The group pulls off a series of 
                daring bank robberies during their performances, rewarding their 
                audiences with the stolen money while staying one step ahead of 
                the law in a world where nothing is as it seems.
