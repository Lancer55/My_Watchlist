            <p>
                Two childhood friends from a small North Indian village chase a police job 
                that promises them the dignity they've long been denied. However, as they 
                inch closer to their dream, mounting desperation and the harsh realities 
                of systemic inequality threaten the lifelong bond that holds them together.
