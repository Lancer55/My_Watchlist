            <p>
                Margaret Tate is a high-powered New York book editor who faces deportation 
                to her native Canada because her visa renewal application was denied. 
                In a moment of desperation, she claims she is engaged to her long-suffering 
                assistant, Andrew Paxton. Andrew agrees to the charade but imposes his own 
                conditions, including a trip to his hometown in Alaska to meet his quirky 
                family. Under the watchful eye of a suspicious immigration official, the 
                mismatched pair must maintain the ruse, leading to unexpected feelings.
