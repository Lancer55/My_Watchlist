            <p>
                A top forensic pathologist, Kang Min-ho, is about to retire to spend time with 
                his returning daughter. However, he is pulled into one last case involving 
                a dismembered corpse. When his daughter is kidnapped by the primary suspect, 
                an environmental activist named Lee Sung-ho, Kang is forced to tamper with 
                autopsy evidence to save her. What follows is a brutal and psychological 
                game of revenge with a shocking conclusion.
