            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                The centuries-old vampire Count Dracula comes to England to seduce 
                his barrister Jonathan Harker's fiancée Mina Murray and inflict 
                havoc in the foreign land. This adaptation is known for its visual 
                grandeur and its attempt to stay closer to Bram Stoker's original 
                epistolary novel, focusing on the tragic romance between Dracula 
                and the reincarnation of his deceased wife.
