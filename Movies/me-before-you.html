            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                Louisa Clark is a quirky, happy-go-lucky woman who takes a job as a 
                caregiver for Will Traynor, a wealthy young banker whose life changed 
                dramatically after a tragic accident. As they spend time together, 
                Louisa's sunny outlook challenges Will's cynical worldview, and a 
                deep bond forms that changes both of their lives in ways they never 
                imagined.
