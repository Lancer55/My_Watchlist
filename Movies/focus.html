            <p>
                Nicky Spurgeon is an extremely accomplished con man who takes an amateur 
                con artist, Jess, under his wing. He teaches her the tricks of the trade, 
                but they become romantically involved, leading Nicky to break it off. 
                Three years later, Jess—now an accomplished femme fatale—shows up in 
                Buenos Aires, throwing Nicky's latest, dangerous scheme into disarray.
