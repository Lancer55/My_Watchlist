            <p>
                A "National Geographic" film crew is taken hostage by an insane hunter, 
                who forces them along on his quest to capture the world's largest - and 
                deadliest - snake. The expedition through the Amazon rainforest turns into 
                a nightmare as the giant anaconda begins hunting the crew members one by one.
