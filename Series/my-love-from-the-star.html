            <p>
                Do Min-joon is an alien who landed on Earth 400 years ago during the Joseon Dynasty 
                period. He possesses a near-perfect appearance and enhanced physical abilities 
                involving his vision, hearing, and speed. Having maintained a cynical view of 
                human beings, he finally has only three months left on Earth. However, he 
                unexpectedly falls for Cheon Song-yi, a famous and blunt Hallyu actress who 
                becomes his neighbor.
