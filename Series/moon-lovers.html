            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                During a total solar eclipse, a 25-year-old 21st-century woman, Go Ha-jin, 
                is transported back in time to the Goryeo Dynasty. She wakes up in the 
                body of Hae Soo and finds herself trapped in the middle of a struggle 
                for power among the many princes of the ruling Wang family. While she 
                initially falls for the gentle 8th Prince, she later develops a deep and 
                tragic bond with the feared 4th Prince, Wang So, who hides his face behind a mask.
