            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                The epic saga of the legendary Thracian gladiator who led a massive 
                slave rebellion against the Roman Republic. Spanning from his 
                rise in the Ludus of Batiatus to the final war against Crassus, 
                the story continues with the "House of Ashur," exploring an 
                alternate history where the cunning manipulator Ashur survived 
                Vesuvius and was gifted a gladiator school of his own.
