            <p>
                Pharma follows the journey of K.P. Vinod (played by Nivin Pauly), a 
                middle-class man who enters the high-stakes world of pharmaceutical 
                marketing. As he climbs the corporate ladder, he uncovers a dark 
                underbelly of unethical practices and corruption. The series 
                highlights his moral struggle as he decides whether to protect 
                his career or the lives of innocent people.
