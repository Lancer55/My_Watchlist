            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                Set within the high-pressure environment of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj 
                International Airport in Mumbai, the series follows Superintendent Arjun Meena 
                and an elite team of customs officers. Tasked by the Finance Ministry to 
                clean up internal corruption and dismantle a global syndicate, they engage 
                in a deadly cat-and-mouse game with the notorious kingpin Bada Chaudhary. 
                The story explores the intricate world of international smuggling corridors 
                spanning from Bangkok to Milan.
