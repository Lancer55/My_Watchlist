            <p>
                Kang Sang-woong is an ordinary civil servant who suddenly gains 
                superhuman strength. However, there is a unique catch: his powers 
                are directly tied to the amount of physical cash he carries, and 
                every heroic act drains his bank account. Alongside a group of 
                misfit heroes with equally bizarre power requirements, he must 
                protect the city while balancing his financial survival and 
                fighting a mysterious organization targeting superhumans.
