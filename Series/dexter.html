            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                By day, Dexter Morgan is a blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department. 
                By night, he is a serial killer who targets other murderers who have managed 
                to escape the justice system. Guided by his adoptive father's "Code," 
                Dexter balances his dark urges with his life as a brother, boyfriend, 
                and forensic expert.
