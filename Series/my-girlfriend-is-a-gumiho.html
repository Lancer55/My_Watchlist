            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                Cha Dae-woong is an aspiring action star who accidentally releases a Gumiho—a 
                legendary nine-tailed fox—who was trapped in a painting for 500 years. 
                After she saves his life by giving him her mystical "fox bead," the two 
                become inseparable. While Dae-woong is initially terrified she might eat 
                his liver, he eventually falls for the quirky, meat-loving fox as she 
                tries to navigate the modern world and fulfill her dream of becoming 
                a real human.
