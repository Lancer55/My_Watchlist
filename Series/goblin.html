            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                Kim Shin is an immortal goblin and protector of souls who has lived for 900 years. 
                He is tired of his immortality and seeks his human bride, the only person who 
                can pull out the sword pierced through his chest and end his life. His life 
                becomes complicated when he meets Ji Eun-tak, a cheerful high school student 
                who claims to be the Goblin's bride, and a Grim Reaper who has no memory of 
                his past life.
